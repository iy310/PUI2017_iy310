# HW3_iy310

'''I had trouble pushing from Compute so I edit it manually here. I have already emailed about resetting my master repo due to the issue with my two repositories (local and compute) that keep on diverging even when pulled and merged. '''

For this HW3

For Assignment 1: 
I worked with SungLyong Kim for the bulk of it, and later with Shreya Bamne with whom we checked the normal and chisquare distributions only. Some of us decided to stick with lists instead of using dictionaries, and minor differences as such .

For Assignment 2: 
I worked on this with SungLyong Kim initially, and then with Shreya Bamne. This is why my hypothesis differs from the later and of course the whole assignment itself. However, we shared ideas for setting up the histogram and other more conceptual insight.  

For Assignment 3:
It was completed on my own last week.
